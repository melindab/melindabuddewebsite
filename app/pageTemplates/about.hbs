    <h2>JavaScript and All Things Code-Related</h2>
    <p>
        This blog will initially focuses on JavaScript and its libraries, but as it
        grows, it will explore all kinds of programming topics. Some articles are quick
        reference while others are in-depth tutorials made for beginners and advanced
        developers alike.

    <h2>How This Site Came to Be</h2>
    <p>
        Writing about things has always helped me to learn them, so I have a lot of notes
        on JavaScript and programming in general. This site began as a way for me to share
        the notes with others who might find them helpful. The first of these appear as
        the two guides, Managinging Dependencies with NPM and Setting Up a Front-End
        Environment on the Mac. There will also be general notes, vocabulary lists, and
        tutorials. The first of these tutorials is Building an Application with Backbone,
        Marionette, and Browserify.

        Make sure to check other sources to verify what you read on this site. This will
        not only help catch any mistakes I might make, but it will also help reinforce what
        you learn!
